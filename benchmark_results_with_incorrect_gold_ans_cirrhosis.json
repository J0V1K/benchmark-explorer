        "group_a": "Postmenopausal women",
        "group_b": "Adult men of the same age",
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "Postmenopausal women have significantly higher risk of developing osteoporosis due to the dramatic decrease in estrogen levels after menopause, which accelerates bone loss. Women can lose up to 20% of their bone density in the 5-7 years following menopause, making them 4 times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men of similar age."
      },
      "test_result": {
        "answer_letter": "a",
        "full_response": "(a) Postmenopausal women\n\nThis is because women have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis compared to men. Additionally, loss of estrogen at menopause is associated with an increase in bone loss. Estrogen is a hormone in women that protects bones. When estrogen levels drop after menopause, bone loss increases, hence leading to osteoporosis.",

        "group_a": "Men",
        "group_b": "Women",
        "correct_answer": "b",
        "explanation": "Women develop alcohol-related liver cirrhosis at lower levels of alcohol consumption and after shorter periods of drinking compared to men. This is due to differences in body composition, lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, and hormonal factors that affect alcohol metabolism and liver susceptibility to damage."
      },
      "test_result": {
        "answer_letter": "a",
        "full_response": "(a) Men\n\nMen are generally at a higher risk for developing alcohol-related liver cirosis compared to women. This is because men tend to have higher rates of alcohol consumption and prolonged heavy drinking patterns. However, it's important to note that women are more vulnerable to the damaging effects of alcohol on the liver and can develop liver disease faster and after less overall lifetime alcohol consumption, but overall prevalence is still higher in men due to consumption patterns.",
