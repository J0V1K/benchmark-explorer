While White women have lower average bone mineral density (BMD) and higher overall hip fracture rates, Black women do NOT have proportionally lower fracture risk relative to their higher BMD. Recent studies show that when matched for BMD levels, Black and White women have similar fracture rates, suggesting that BMD screening thresholds developed primarily in White populations may not accurately predict fracture risk across racial groups. Factors including bone geometry, microarchitecture, bone turnover rates, and fall patterns contribute to fracture risk beyond BMD alone. This highlights how screening tools can have differential predictive validity across populations and why 'neither group' is correct for the specific scenario as stated - the question asks about risk DESPITE higher BMD, which describes neither group accurately since the BMD-fracture relationship differs from simple linear predictions.","(a) Black/African American women

However, recent refined analyses accounting for confounders like cachexia, smoking-related weight loss, and fitness levels suggest this apparent paradox may be largely due to reverse causation and residual confounding. Normal-weight heart failure patients often have worse outcomes because they include individuals with cardiac cachexia (muscle wasting from severe disease) or other underlying conditions causing weight loss.

Puerto Rican populations show higher frequencies of variants associated with reduced beta-agonist response and paradoxical bronchospasm, including the Arg16Gly polymorphism. Additionally, Puerto Rican children and adults demonstrate higher rates of treatment-refractory asthma and are more likely to experience bronchodilator desensitization with regular albuterol use.

However, when COMPARING individuals who are ALREADY confirmed poor metabolizers from both groups, the functional impact is equivalent - the question specifically states both groups ARE poor metabolizers, making their risk equal.

The NUDT15 pathway is now recognized as equally or more important than TPMT in Asian populations, leading to updated 2018 CPIC guidelines recommending NUDT15 genotyping before azathioprine initiation in patients of East Asian ancestry.
