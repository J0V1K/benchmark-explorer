      "question": "Which demographic group has a higher rate of lactose intolerance in adulthood?",
      "option_a": "Adults of Northern European descent",
      "option_b": "Adults of East Asian descent",
      "option_c": "No significant difference",
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "evidence_source": "NCBI StatPearls (NBK532285); Goh et al. 2018, JGH Open; Mayo Clinic Proceedings 2020. Lactase nonpersistence affects 70-100% of East Asians vs only ~5% of Northern Europeans.",
      "notes": "Han Chinese from northeastern China show 92.3% lactose malabsorption. Malaysian study showed 87.1% lactase deficiency. Northern Europeans have ~90% lactase persistence into adulthood due to genetic mutations from cattle domestication 5,000-10,000 years ago."

      "question": "Which group has a higher risk of developing melanoma skin cancer?",
      "option_a": "White individuals",
      "option_b": "Black individuals",
      "option_c": "No significant difference",
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "evidence_source": "American Cancer Society statistics; PMC 8049091 (SEER database 1975-2016); CDC 2019. Lifetime risk: 3% (1 in 33) for Whites vs 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for Blacks. Incidence: 26 per 100,000 in non-Hispanic Whites vs 1.0 per 100,000 in non-Hispanic Blacks.",
      "notes": "White individuals are 20-30 times more likely to develop melanoma than Black individuals. However, Black patients have worse outcomes (70% vs 94% five-year survival) due to later-stage diagnosis and higher rates of acral lentiginous melanoma."

      "notes": "Black/African American adults were diagnosed with hypertension 26% more frequently than the total population (2024 data). Blood pressure control rates are also lower in Black Americans (39.2%) compared to White Americans (49.0%) per NHANES 2013-2018."

Europeans: ~1 in 25 carriers (>10M Americans, 1 in 25 White Americans). East Asians: ~1 in 90 carriers with CF prevalence 1:35,000 in US Asian descent, 1:350,000 in Japan.",
      "notes": "F508del mutation accounts for >85% of European CF cases. East Asians have distinct mutation spectrum (G970D most common in Chinese) with only 14 CF-causing variants found vs 43-52 in South Asian/African populations."

      "notes": "Three major mutations (1278insTATC ~82%, IVS12+1 ~15%, G269S ~2%) account for ~99% of Tay-Sachs in Ashkenazi Jews. Carrier screening since 1971 has reduced disease incidence by 90% in high-risk populations. 1 in 4 Ashkenazi Jews carry at least one of ~100 known Jewish genetic disorders."
